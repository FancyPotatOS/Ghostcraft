#   Grappling Hook Launch
#   
#   Purpose: To launch a player based on their grappling hook data
#
#   Input: Player data: SelectedItem.components."minecraft:custom_data".ghostcraft{type:"grappling_hook"}.bobber_data{Pos[double, double, double]}
#
#   Executor: Player
#


# $y player_motion.api.launch
# # 10000 is equivalent to  5 blocks
# # 14500 is equivalent to 10 blocks
# # 19400 is equivalent to 17 blocks

# (Scaled down by 1000)
# # Formula is  y = 0.034*x^2 + 1.284*x - 1.214
# Used approximation: 0.83y + 4.1 = 1.2x
