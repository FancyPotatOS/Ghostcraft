# GhostCraft
<em>Recreated by FancyPotatOS</em>

<em>Probably owned by [The ShotBow Network](https://shotbow.net/)</em>


This is my attempt at remaking a GhostCraft clone using just vanilla resources. It currently has everything I initially planned on doing - including kits and maps!

Please enjoy this little piece of 2013 Minecraft love


### Requirements
- The [player_motion](https://modrinth.com/datapack/player_motion) datapack
- The [BlockState](https://github.com/Triton365/BlockState) datapack


### Credits
- [Sanctum](https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/sanctum-a-ghostcraft-map.77827/) map created by [Subject_617](https://shotbow.net/forum/members/subject_617.1984/)
- [Katerbrandt Library](https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/map-submission-the-katerbrandt-library.326662/#post-2647846) map created by [Moshyn](https://shotbow.net/forum/members/moshyn.1122691/)



## Server Details

If you are running a server, please ensure that it is compatible with the [player_motion](https://modrinth.com/datapack/player_motion) datapack. Some optimizations from servers like Paper break some functionality like ghost boosting.

This datapack requires the included resource pack. Here is some of the <b>server.properties</b> values you can set to ensure the players have access to it and use it (Otherwise you can cheat and see the ghost easily)

It includes a google drive link to my copy of the resource pack, so feel free to use it.

- require-resource-pack=true
- resource-pack=https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1maLEcFD1UlEJ5Wbpb0_RgZ1rNojbl2c6
- resource-pack-prompt=This resource pack is required to play GhostCraft. Compatible with vanilla Minecraft.
